🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project: CLI Manager MCP

As developers, we often have multiple terminal windows open while working on complex projects. Switching between them, remembering which service runs where, and managing setup workflows takes valuable time.

CLI Manager MCP solves this by bringing AI-powered terminal management to Claude Desktop.

What it does:
✅ Manages multiple terminal sessions automatically
✅ Remembers your project architecture & dependencies
✅ Starts services in the correct order
✅ Lets you control everything through natural language

Just say: "Start my full-stack project"
And Claude handles the rest.

Built with TypeScript and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it's ready for:
• Microservices architectures
• Monorepos (Turborepo/Nx)
• Single applications
• Docker-based workflows

Check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/yksanjo/cli-manager-mcp

Would love your feedback and contributions!

```
🧵 Tired of managing 5+ terminal windows while coding?

I built CLI Manager MCP - an AI-powered terminal management system for Claude Desktop.

Here's how it changes the game 👇

🔗 https://github.com/yksanjo/cli-manager-mcp
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The Problem:

You open Terminal 1 for backend
Terminal 2 for frontend  
Terminal 3 for database
Terminal 4 for workers
Terminal 5 for Redis

Then you forget which is which and waste time switching 🙃
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The Solution:

Just tell Claude: "Start my project"

✅ Loads your config
✅ Creates all terminals
✅ Starts services in order
✅ Handles dependencies
✅ Shows you status

One command. Everything running. 🚀
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
It remembers your architecture:

• Microservices ✅
• Monorepos ✅
• Docker workflows ✅
• Custom setups ✅

Define once. Use forever.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Example workflow:

You: "Run tests across all services"

Claude: 
✓ API: 24 tests passed
✓ Frontend: 18 tests passed  
✓ Workers: 8 tests passed

All green! ✅
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
Built with:
• TypeScript
• Model Context Protocol
• node-pty
• Lots of coffee ☕

Open source & ready to use.

Show HN: CLI Manager MCP – Let Claude manage your terminals

I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets Claude create,
manage, and monitor terminal sessions automatically.

Instead of juggling multiple terminal windows, you just tell Claude
"start my project" and it handles everything.

It remembers your project architecture, handles service dependencies,
and lets you control everything through natural language.

GitHub: https://github.com/yksanjo/cli-manager-mcp

Built with TypeScript and node-pty. Works with microservices, monorepos,
and any project structure.

Would love feedback from the HN community!

[Showoff Saturday] I built an AI-powered terminal manager for Claude

Hey devs! I got tired of managing multiple terminal windows while working
on my microservices project, so I built CLI Manager MCP.

It's an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets Claude:
• Create and manage terminal sessions
• Start services in dependency order
• Remember your project architecture
• Run commands across multiple services

You just say things like:
- "Start my project" → launches everything
- "Run tests" → tests all services
- "Check the backend logs" → shows recent output

It works with any project structure - microservices, monorepos, single apps.

Check it out: https://github.com/yksanjo/cli-manager-mcp

Let me know what you think!

Hey there,

Quick share: I just open-sourced CLI Manager MCP, a tool that lets Claude Desktop manage your terminal sessions automatically.

**The problem it solves:**
If you're working on microservices or complex projects, you're probably juggling multiple terminal windows. This handles all of that for you.

**How it works:**
You define your project structure in a JSON config once. Then just tell Claude "start my project" and it creates all the terminals, starts services in the right order, and monitors everything.

**Cool features:**
- Dependency-aware service startup
- Natural language control
- Works with any architecture (microservices, monorepos, etc.)
- Remembers your common commands
